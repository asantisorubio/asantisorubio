## About me

Hi, I'm Adrián Santiso Rubio.

I have recently graduated in Biochemistry from UAM.
I'm currently studying the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Master at UAM while I work as a student researcher in CIB-Margarita Salas.
What is my passion? Research and discussing about science, specially with nice people around ;)
I plan to do PhD in the near future.

## About the Repository
My intention is to share/upload the projects I am doing in the Master and maybe some interesting tools, scripts, analysis...

## Get in Touch
I am always open to feedback, collaborations and any job offer.
My constitutional email is adrian.santiso@estudiante.uam.es.
